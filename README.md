## Overview
Campus Courier is a student-centric Android app designed to streamline the acquisition of essential items for SUTD students. Whether it's groceries, household items, or project materials, students can post requests for essential items they need. Other students can then accept these requests, purchase the items, and arrange for delivery, providing an avenue for them to earn some side cash while helping their peers.

Users can seamlessly switch between roles as requestors and suppliers, each offering a tailored user interface. Requestors benefit from real-time tracking of their posted requests, while suppliers manage their accepted requests through a to-do checklist. The app allows for efficient browsing through a search function based on string input and filtering by location and category, streamlining the process of finding and fulfilling requests.

Beyond its practical utility, Campus Courier cultivates a culture of mutual support and collaboration among students, enriching the university experience and fostering a sense of community within the SUTD campus.
